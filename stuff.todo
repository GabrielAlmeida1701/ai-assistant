TODOs:
    ✔ Replace history with a mysql table @done(23-06-04 17:38)
        the table should have the user massage, the bot's message and a creation date
        when creating context the X more recent messages should be pulled
        for refinig the bot's training data all messages should be pulled
    ✔ Replace websockets with http server @done(23-06-07 19:23)
    ☐ Reload nescessary settings on save
    ☐ Add a way for when returning the last message also go through the plugins again
    ☐ Add intent recognition
        the intent recognition should help define what goes into the context
    ☐ Add langchain to pipeline
        when requesting something it should go through RetrievalQA.from_chain_type
        langchain & chroma are responsable for older context
        history for current conversation
        the template should be
            SYSTEM
            CHROMA
            HISTORY
            User_Input...
    ☐ Add more info to the context
        ☐ Current user emotion (based on last user_input)
        ☐ Current bot emotion (based on last response)
        ☐ Current time
        ☐ Last message time
    ☐ Research increasing the context awreness
        Try to add a way so Yumi know what the user is doing at the current moment so she can provide useful info on the subject
    ☐ Multi-Language (maybe this works already, but i need to test it)
