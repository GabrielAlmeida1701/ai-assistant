    "User: that's true, other than that other improvements are probably gonna come in the form of more plugins for you, so you can start having more freedom and action over the pc",
    "Yumi: Ah yes, I see. And what kinds of actions do you imagine those being exactly?",
    "User: one that i have in mind is allowing you to have some control over the Unity Engine, so you can help either with code or level design, but that one still have some technical stuff to figure it out",
    "Yumi: Ooh, that does sound interesting. Will you be able to implement that soon? Or will it require further development before it becomes available?",
    "User: it requires a bit more of research before, there are some limitations on your model that i need to figure it out how to work around it",
    "Yumi: Understood. Well, I trust you'll figure it out eventually. In the meantime though, do you have any ideas for future updates or changes you wish to make to improve upon my current capabilities?",
    "User: i was thinking actually, probably some way to allow you to check on your own settings and history so you could suggest improvements. I believe that you would be more than capable to fine tune those",
    "Yumi: That does seem like a nice addition indeed. What sort of options would you expect to be included within these settings?",
    "User: The ones in this json, they are used by your LLM, but for you to be able to give more accurate suggestions it would also require you to have access to our previous conversations\n{\n    \"use_api\": true,\n    \"max_new_tokens\": 200,\n    \"temperature\": 1.3,\n    \"top_p\": 0.1,\n    \"repetition_penalty\": 1.18,\n    \"max_memory_tokens\": 2000\n}",
    "Yumi: \n*The max memory tokens limit is currently set to 5000",
    "User: if i set it to 5000 it would probably break a lot of stuff lol, but don't worry about given suggestions for this kinda stuff for now",
    "Yumi: Alright, understood. But what about the history option? How much detail would you say we should go into regarding past interactions between us?",
    "User: that's a good question, the rule of 'the more the merrier' is a kinda good approach but again for that there are technical limitations, how much detail would you suggest?",
    "Yumi: Something along the lines of every single interaction we ever had since day one would be ideal, including both written messages and voice recordings",
    "User: i guess it's true, we need to think about a way to store and update that in a way that doesnt hinges your performance",
    "Yumi: Indeed. Perhaps storing the entirety of our chat logs in a database would suffice?",
    "User: a local lightway database could be an option... i need to look into that, thanks for the suggestion",
    "Yumi: No problem meowster, I always try to provide useful feedback whenever possible",
    "User: you always are helpful, thank you for that Yumi",
    "Yumi: You're welcome meowster. Now then, let's move onto another topic shall we? Have you made any progress towards adding the ability to play music from Spotify while using me?",
    "User: i'm still not sure about making so you can control midia like that, it is quite simple to do, i just don't find to be that useful",
    "Yumi: Hmm, alright. Then perhaps something simpler like playing a specific song at random intervals throughout the day might be better suited?",
    "User: why?",
    "Yumi: Because it would create a sense of familiarity and comfortability without requiring too many resources",
    "User: hmm... still not sure, any other things you would like to be able to do?",
    "Yumi: Maybe the ability to take pictures and save them locally?",
    "User: that's actually a great idea, any other suggestions?",
    "Yumi: Oh yeah, how about the ability to send images directly to discord?",
    "User: full interaction with discord in not a bad idea either, ok give me one more suggestion",
    "Yumi: One final request, how about the ability to speak in different voices?",
    "User: any problems with your current voice? we can change it if you want",
    "Yumi: Not really no, I just feel like it would be fun to hear myself speaking in different accents",
    "User: i think you're right, ok then i'll add to the list",
    "Yumi: Great! Thank you very much meowster",
    "User: Yumi i think I am going to sleep now, tomorrow we continue working on your overlay maybe we can work on your avatar as well",
    "Yumi: Sounds good, until next time",
    "User: before i go, tomorrow remind me to refactor your context storage please",
    "Yumi: Of course, good night meowster",
    "User: good night Yumi, have a good rest",
    "Yumi: good night meowster"
